# SEI Testnet ENS Error Fix

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

Error: `network does not support ENS (operation="getEnsAddress", info={ "network": { "chainId": "1328", "name": "unknown" } }, code=UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION, version=6.15.0)`

### Root Cause:
- Ethers.js was attempting ENS resolution on SEI testnet
- SEI testnet doesn't support ENS (Ethereum Name Service)
- This happened when passing wallet addresses to contract functions

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. Address Validation & Normalization
```typescript
private validateAddress(address: string): string {
  if (!ethers.isAddress(address)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid address format: ${address}`)
  }
  return ethers.getAddress(address) // Normalize without ENS lookup
}
```

### 2. Cached Signer Address
```typescript
// Cache the signer address during initialization
this.signerAddress = await this.signer.getAddress()

// Use cached address instead of calling getAddress() repeatedly
const isApproved = await this.minterContract.isApprovedForAll(
  this.signerAddress, // Cached, no ENS lookup
  CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.MEME_SALE
)
```

### 3. Explicit Address Validation in mintNFT
```typescript
async mintNFT(to: string, tokenURI: string, trendHash: string) {
  // Validate and normalize the address to prevent ENS lookup
  const validAddress = this.validateAddress(to)
  console.log('Minting NFT to address:', validAddress)
  
  const tx = await this.minterContract.mintTo(validAddress, tokenURI, trendHash)
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Network Logging
```typescript
// Log network details during initialization
const network = await this.provider.getNetwork()
console.log('Connected to network:', network.name, 'Chain ID:', network.chainId.toString())
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Why This Happened:
1. **ENS Resolution**: Ethers.js automatically tries to resolve addresses as ENS names
2. **Unknown Network**: SEI testnet shows as "unknown" network to ethers.js
3. **Unsupported Operation**: ENS operations fail on non-Ethereum networks

### How We Fixed It:
1. **Bypass ENS**: Use `ethers.getAddress()` for normalization only
2. **Address Validation**: Check `ethers.isAddress()` before processing
3. **Cache Addresses**: Store resolved addresses to avoid repeated calls
4. **Direct Addressing**: Pass validated addresses directly to contracts

## 🚀 **Result**

- ✅ No more ENS resolution attempts
- ✅ Direct address usage for all contract calls
- ✅ Proper error handling for invalid addresses
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging
- ✅ Cached addresses for performance

## 🧪 **Testing Verification**

The fix ensures:
1. **Minting works** with any valid Ethereum address
2. **No ENS errors** on SEI testnet
3. **Address validation** catches invalid inputs
4. **Performance improved** with cached addresses

## 📝 **Usage Notes**

- All wallet addresses are now validated before use
- Console logs show network and address details
- Error messages are more descriptive
- No impact on gas costs or functionality

The NFT minting should now work seamlessly on SEI testnet without any ENS-related errors! 🎉
